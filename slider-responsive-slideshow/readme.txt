Create responsive image sliders with carousel effects, touch navigation, and custom animations for your website.

== Description ==

Responsive Slideshow helps you build image sliders that work smoothly on all devices. Whether you need a simple photo slider for your homepage or a carousel to showcase client logos, this plugin handles it without any coding.

The slider adjusts automatically to different screen sizes, so your images look sharp on desktops, tablets, and phones. Touch and swipe gestures work out of the box, making it easy for mobile visitors to browse through your slides.

After activating the plugin, go to the Responsive Slideshow menu and click "Add New Slider". Upload images from your Media Library, arrange them in your preferred order, and save. Copy the generated shortcode and paste it where you want the slider to appear.

= Can I add links to individual slides? =

Yes, each slide has a link field where you can enter any URL. When visitors click on that slide, they will be taken to the linked page.

= Is the slider mobile-friendly? =

Absolutely. The slider is fully responsive and includes touch/swipe support. It automatically adjusts to fit any screen size and works smoothly on phones and tablets.

= How many images can I add to a slider? =

There is no fixed limit. You can add as many images as you need, though keeping it reasonable (under 20-30) helps with page load times.

= Can I use the slider in my sidebar or footer? =

Yes, you can paste the slider shortcode into any text widget. The slider will resize to fit the widget area automatically.

= Does it support touch and swipe gestures? =

Yes, touch and swipe navigation is built in. Mobile users can swipe left or right to browse through slides naturally.

= How do I change the slider speed? =

In the slider settings, you will find options to control auto-play speed and transition duration. Adjust these values to match your preference.

= Can I add captions to my slides? =

Yes, each slide supports a title and description field. The text appears as an overlay on the slide, and you can style it using the available options.

= How do I show multiple slides at once like a carousel? =

The carousel mode with multiple visible slides is available in the Pro version. It lets you display 2, 3, or more slides simultaneously.

= The slider is not showing on my page. What should I check? =

Make sure you have published the slider (not just saved as draft) and that you are using the correct shortcode with the right ID. Also check if your theme has any JavaScript conflicts.
